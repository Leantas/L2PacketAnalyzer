<!-- This packet may be related to early pledge implementations (most likely before pledge levels). Otherwise, it is a scrapped feature. -->
<!-- Modern servers disconnect the client when they receive this packet. -->
<!-- Even in legacy servers the implementation seems to only mark you as a "clan member" (unable to create/join pledge), without actually assigning a real pledge ID or activating clan UI features -->
