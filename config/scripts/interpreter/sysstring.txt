2706	<font color='#FFDF4C'>Humans</font> were created by Gran Kain but they worship Einhasad, the Goddess of Light. They've mastered the powers of combat as well as magic and they are adept in any class role.
2707	Created by Einhasad through the Mother Tree, <font color='#FFDF4C'>Elves</font> are agile and dextrous. Deeply in tune with the forces of nature, they worship Eva, the Goddess of Water, and dwell in the protection of the Mother Tree.
2708	<font color='#FFDF4C'>Dark Elves</font> were once of the Elf race. They split off to pursue their worship of Shilen and dark magic, but she proved to be too evil and the Dark Elves now stand on their own.
2709	<font color='#FFDF4C'>Orcs</font> were created by fire to be a race of undying strength and stamina, in worship of the God of Fire Pa'agrio. Once servants of the Giants, Orcs are powerful warriors.
2710	<font color='#FFDF4C'>Dwarves</font> were made from and worship the God of Earth Maphr. Their heartiness makes them excel at crafting, resource gathering, and heavy combat with multiple enemies.
2711	<font color='#FFDF4C'>Kamaels</font> were created by the Gods as living combat weapons, but the rest of their origin is shrouded in mystery. They worship Mother Nornil and collect souls in her name.
