0.8-SNAPSHOT:

Further work on internal dependency redimization.
Support for NA infinite odyssey protocol 24.
Fixed an issue where reloading packet definitions would cause the active packet display configuration to be reset, even if it is exactly the same as saved to file.
More interpreters & updated entity name lists.
Reintroduced support for l2j login servers.

Internal refactoring related to de-bloating & opensourcing dependencies.

Fixed issues with CPU hogging while connecting to a server or after failing to connect to a server.

Packet structure handling implementation related changes:
Field value condition/interpreter/modifier implementation moved to netpro-commons. It is a fundamental way to deal with typed fields; not merely restricted to L2 or GUI mode.
As a result, netpro-commons-ui was removed. The implementation was changed to better suit today's use cases.
Added protocol 610 definition.

Support for legacy login ServerList with > 1 gameserver injection. Also, legacy ServerLists are now properly interpreted.
Support for running on a JRE; script.cache is now included in a release by default.
Ability to use a single NP as a hub for proxying multiple login servers.
Ability to advertise both local and internet IPs in ServerList packet.
Packet content interpretation for packets to be injected.
Incremental loading of opcode_mapping.xml files AND a thorough review of their content.
Definitions for packets "actually in use" by prelude beta client & server. Due to incremental loading, this means less XMLs in GF/HF folders (in certain cases, Valiance was also affected).
Few minor fixes in packet definitions applicable to Ertheia.
New example script: examples.game.AntiSpam (filters bot RWT advertisement spam; configurable).
FastLogin support for legacy login servers (except security card).
Network I/O configuration options added & default values optimized.
Configuration option not to open tabs for login connections has been added.

FastLogin now supports PIN-less definitions.
FastLogin now supports Security Card authorization.
Added additional packet log filtering by regex, accessible right within the packet table. [michael1414]
Added the ability to pause/resume packet logging to the packet table. [michael1414]
Added IP aliases to be used within the UI (including free samples :).
Added a bottom information panel.
Changed L&F initialization to respect a manually set L&F system property, as well as to select the native L&F by default (instead of Nimbus). [LoneRanger]

Moved scripts outside the application JAR.
